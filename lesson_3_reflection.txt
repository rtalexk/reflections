When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you are working on a project where there are more than one coder, you and someone else or when you want to keep your work safe storing not just on your computer but in another place, like github!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Well, maybe cuz when you're working in a big change, and you pull the updated version it have
    different behavior than can affect your work, then is prefered wait until you have done your
    work to pull the remote changes and if there are some conflicts just solve it

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks is the same project cloned onto your git account to go in another direction of the
    original project. Clone make a copy of a remote project. A branch belong to a repository, it is
    like a fork but your own project. You use a fork when you want part of a base project and make a
    different one with the original base characteristics and continue giving the credit to its
    author. You clone a project when you want a copy of another one. You create a branch when you
    want make a experimental functionality of the project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    With that git can know if is up-to-date of if there diferences between remote and local
    repository
